## Implementation Notes

1. **Easy words** are short, concrete, and easy to draw (animals, simple objects, basic actions)
2. **Medium words** are longer but still drawable (complex animals, nature scenes, compound objects)
3. **Hard words** are abstract concepts, long words, or things difficult to represent visually

4. **Category balance** ensures variety in gameplay
5. **All words** are from the official BIP-39 list for authenticity
6. **~600 words selected** from 2048 total (most drawable/playable ones)

This provides a good balance for a drawing game while maintaining the BIP-39 theme!
